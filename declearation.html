                I hereby declare and affirm that the information I have provided to
                Tech Mahindra Limited is complete and accurate, and no information
                whatsoever, including without limitation, my previous employment
                and/or business activities has been withheld, omitted, concealed or
                misstated by me. I further confirm that I have not omitted any
                relevant information unless permitted to do so in accordance with
                local law. I further declare that I have not been convicted for any
                criminal offence in the past and no criminal action is pending against
                me before any competent court. I understand, confirm and agree that a
                false statement or omission of facts by me, will entitle Tech Mahindra
                Limited to forthwith withdraw the offer of employment or terminate my
                employment with immediate effect without requiring to provide any
                notice period and/or salary in lieu of notice period.
